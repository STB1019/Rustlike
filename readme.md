# Rustlike: A Simple Roguelike made in Rust

Rustlike is a CMD roguelike in the style of [Rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28video_game%29) and [Nethack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack) made by following an online tutorial: https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook

The goal of this project is to introduce its members to the Rust programming language by using it in a real-world scenario. The implementation will, at first, follow line by line the tutorial to, hopefully, divert at one point with custom code and implementations.
